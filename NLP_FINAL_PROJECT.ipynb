As you've also learned, the reversible residual has two equations for the forward-pass so doing just one of them will just constitute half of the reversible decoder block. Before doing the second equation (i.e. second half of the reversible residual), it first needs to swap the elements to take into account the stack semantics in Trax. It simply puts `x2` on top of the stack so it can be fed to the add block of the half-residual layer. It then swaps the two outputs again so it can be fed to the next layer of the network. All of these arrives at the two equations in Part 3 and it can be used to recompute the activations during the backward pass.\n",
